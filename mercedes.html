    <h1>Mercedes</h1>
    Mercedes-Benz, the world's oldest car manufacturer, pioneered many automotive firsts, including the first patented automobile (Benz Patent-Motorwagen in 1886), the first hybrid car (1906), crumple zones (1950s), anti-lock brakes (1970s), and
    airbags (1980s), with its iconic three-pointed star symbolizing dominance on land, air, and sea, all while maintaining a legacy of luxury, performance, and innovation, notes Wikipedia and Mr Key.
